# Karden
Karden is a Web3 personal homepage that aims to afford the service of digital assets management, assets exhibition, and information integration.  Web2 developers can quickly start up their Web3 applications with optimized APIs supported by Karden.

Karden now has three core products——Kard, Kard Protocol and KardGrid.

Kard is a new type of NFT that points to an execution file designed with features like small size, dynamically loaded, cross-platform, and metadata possessed by the user.  There is no need to provide a real-name system, it publishes without official approval, and users can sell and purchase it within any NFT market.

KardProtocol provides API and NFT toolkits for developing Kard, which structure a Kard execution file and provide packaging and publishing tools to ensure it is loaded successfully by the container, while most Web 3.0 APIs have been packaged beforehand. It takes less than 30 minutes to start.

KardGrid is a cross-platform Kard loader maintained by the official, providing containers to load Kards and implement KardProtocol API. It can load any NFT on the page, including images, audio files, or apps. They will be exhibited properly. Users can compose NFTs as their wish by dragging and hauling.

Kard is implemented with full rendering performance on the browser engine, which fits better in interactive use cases like information monitoring, dynamic display, subscription notification, and quick tools. Therefore KardGrid becomes the personal space for users to manage their content sources, digital assets, and profiles —— more than just a dashboard.

Karden’ goal is to be the starting place for developers and general users who are willing to embrace Web3, by visualizing the digital assets on blockchain on an interactive interface and integrating fractional information on Web3.
